## Description

I am working for a marketing agency and have been given the task of improving the accessesibilty of their website - Horiseon. Making the website more accessible will help users with disabilities to navigate the site and also improve the ranking in search engines like Google. I have learned the importance of using semantic HTML tags such as <header>, <footer>, <section> etc as they improve SEO and give structure to webpages.
